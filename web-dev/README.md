# Web Dev Tutorials

## Purpose

These tutorials are to get you up to speed on how to code for the most ubiquitous application platform: the browser. You can think of the browser as a sandbox, a
siloed environment that will run (almost) any code you give it. I highly recommend learning at least the basics of web development given how often its used.

## Intro

Web development is the art of designing and programming websites and web apps. As such, you'll learn HTML, JavaScript, and (some) CSS in these tutorials as
these languages are the cornerstone of the web. As you might have read online, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the language used to declare the layout and structure
of a web page. JavaScript is the programming language that adds interactivity and custom behavior. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) gives sites styling,
like colors, gradients, shadows, etc. All three are needed to make good websites.

## How the web works

It's important to know how the web works before diving into web development.
