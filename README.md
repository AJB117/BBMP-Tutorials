# BBMP-Tutorials

Programming tutorials for Building Bridges students at Notre Dame.

This is a repo meant to teach the basics of programming! You'll find folders here for teaching web development, backend development, mobile development, and some machine learning.

These tutorials are not meant to be comprehensive. It will teach you the basics of how to get started with various kinds of development, but its primary focus is on implementation, not things like algorithms/data structure design or heavy math. Use these tutorials to get you started in your path learning to become a programmer/software engineer.

## Basic Setup

### Operating System (OS)

Programming is different across operating systems. Typically, most developer tools and libraries are built assuming some kind of UNIX operating system (e.g. Mac or Linux), although most tools and libraries also work with Windows.

Typically, installation of tools and libraries is more straightforward for Mac and Linux, but there are also straightforward ways of installing for Windows. Generally, it won't matter, and these tutorials will do its best to acommodate all OSs, but if you run into issues, a quick Google will probably reveal the best solution for your specific OS.

### Text Editor

To program, you'll need software for editing code. There's a lot of options for this. Some popular options:

- [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) editor products for specific programming languages

I personally use VSCode, and many of the tutorials here will assume it, but the choice is yours. Most editors can do what all the others can.

### General Knowledge

See the `general` folder [here](./general/README.md) for some documents for general knowledge before starting the other tutorials in this repo.
